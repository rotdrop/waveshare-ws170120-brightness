# WaveShare WS170120 Brightness

A simple python pip module and script in order to control the
backlight of a WaveShare WS170120 touchscreen. The tools provided by
Waveshare are binary only and are only able to set the brightness in
steps of 10%, while the hardware supports steps of 1%.

The project has been generated from some simple USB capturing. The
protocol is easy enough, see ![file_list](reverse-engineering/USB-Protocol.md)
